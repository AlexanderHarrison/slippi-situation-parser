# SLP Parser
Parses slp files. Not everything is parsed, only the information needed in RWing.
Orders of magnitude faster with fewer dependencies than peppi.
Does not support stream based parsing, however.

It also supports reading and writing notes to slp files.

WIP work on parsing into higher level actions (wavedash, SHFFL nair, ledgedash, etc.).
